Changing the font of the operating system to Gothic or Gaelic helps tremendously. It makes it much easier to read ancient and medieval texts. The font does not contain characters with macrons and ligatures. For these types of characters you would need to set the compose key. Macrons are not necessary and the only thing that needs to be changed is the font. Extra letters and ligatures are unnecessary.

It is not necassary to install unicode. You only need to change the font on the computer. Unicode is a real drag to work with and is rather complicated. I did change the "R" to "Ꞃ" and the "S" to "Ꞅ". I personally feel it is a bit more refined. From what I understand, it was used in Latin, middle Irish, and middle English. Many of the calligraphy styles is based upon region. This font is a Dublin font.

## Installing On Fedora
Fedora was a much easier experience. Just add the font file into the Font Manager by clicking "Install From File". You will probably need to restart your computer for the font to be properly loaded into the Font Manager. Go to Fonts in Settings. Click "Adjust all fonts". Click the check box for Fonts. Click "CelticDublinFont". Click OK and then Apply.
## Installing On Ubuntu
I could never get Ubuntu to work properly. Ubuntu has a hard time rendering the fonts correctly in the web browser.
## Installing on Windows 10/Windows 11

## Installing on Andriod
